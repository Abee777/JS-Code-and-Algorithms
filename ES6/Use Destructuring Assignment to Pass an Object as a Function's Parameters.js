//***Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters***
//In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}

//This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. 
//This can also be done in-place:

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}


/*TASK - Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half 
to send only max and min inside the function.*/

const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// change code below this line
const half = ({max, min}) => (max + min) / 2.0; 
// change code above this line

console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015
