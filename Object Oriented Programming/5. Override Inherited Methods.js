/*The ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype
ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);
ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...}; 	

It's possible to override an inherited method. Here's an example of Bird 
overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:
*/
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

// Inherit all methods from Animal
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};

/*If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), 
this is how JavaScript looks for the method on duckâ€™s prototype chain:

1. duck => Is eat() defined here? No.

2. Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.

3. Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before 
reaching this level.

4. Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level. */
